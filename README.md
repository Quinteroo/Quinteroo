# Hi 👋🏻, I'm **qugodev** 

[![Codewars Badge](https://www.codewars.com/users/Quinteroo/badges/large)](https://www.codewars.com/users/quinteroo)

Hi 👋! 
I am a frontend web developer with a couple of years of experience in design and development so I am comfortable working with programming languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript.  

In recent years, I’ve realized that developing user interfaces satisfies my passion for creativity, which is why I enjoy working with React.js and CSS.  

One of my strengths is my 14 years of experience in the hospitality industry across Spain and England. I worked as an F&B Director, managing teams of up to 30 people and overseeing sales and production costs, identifying errors and opportunities for improvement. This experience has shaped me into an empathetic, methodical, and organized person—qualities I now bring to my freelance software development work.  

I love the ecommerce sector, practicing kickboxing and dipping cookies in coffee 🍪☕
Thank you for reading! 💙
